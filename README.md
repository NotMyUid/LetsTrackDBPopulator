# LetsTrackDBPopulator

Java populator for LetstTrack SAP CAP application.

In order to use it, you'll have to substitue the paths in the .java file with the paths in which you have placed the files in "Files" folder. 
To have CSV files you simply should rename the .txt files obtained in output.

In "Files", under the "CSV" folder, we also uploaded the .csv files we used in our current implementation.
As you'll notice, in order to make them fully-compatible with SAP HANA, we added the header as the first line.
